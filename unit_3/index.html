	<h1>Dorothy Wang</h1>

	<p id="pith">Freelance photographer/videographer/storyteller -- fueled by fresh air, rad people, and a cruetly-free, plant-based diet.</p>

	<p>I recently moved from DC to Charlottesville to study Computer Science and Media Studies at the University of Virginia. Photography has been my passion since I discovered how a camera can help capture memories. Photography is my excuse to travel and explore all the nooks and crannies of this world -- although who really needs an excuse to travel? Grown in the wild and fueled by fresh air, I'm just here living for the adventure. Follow my journey.</p>
