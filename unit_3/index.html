	<h1>DOROTHY WANG</h1>

	<h2 id="pith">Freelance photographer, videographer, and storyteller.<br> 
	Fueled by fresh air, rad people, and a cruetly-free, plant-based diet.</h2>

	

	<p>I recently moved from DC to Charlottesville to study Computer Science and Media Studies at the University of Virginia.<br> Photography has been my passion since I discovered how a camera can help capture memories and tell stories.<br>
	Photography is my excuse to travel and explore all the nooks and crannies of this world -- although who really needs an excuse to travel?<br>
	Grown in the wild and fueled by fresh air, I'm just here living for the adventure. Follow my journey.</p>
