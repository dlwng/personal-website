		<!-- <p>I recently moved from DC to Charlottesville to study Computer Science and Media Studies at the University of Virginia.<br> Photography has been my passion since I discovered how a camera can help capture memories and tell stories.<br>
		Photography is my excuse to travel and explore all the nooks and crannies of this world -- although who really needs an excuse to travel?<br>
		Grown in the wild and fueled by fresh air, I'm just here living for the adventure. Follow my journey.</p> -->
